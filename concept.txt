Every user creates a private/public keypair on a smartcard. The user
signs the string 'ClosePopcorn!!!!1ELF' and sends this file encrypted
to all board members and keeps it safe (this will be the file which is
used for revocation, if needed).

The verification controller(tm) has a copy of all public keys which are
allowed to enter. They are in a directory, where the filenames are the
handles of the users who are allowed to enter.

We create a list of those keys using
$ sha512sum * | sort -n

This list is signed with a OpenPGP key whose password is 2/5
secret shared between the board members. Thus, 2 board members can
work together to add a person to the list.

As revocation is more time-critical then adding people to the list,
there is also a revocation directory which contains the revocation files
for the users. The files can be added to the directory by anyone using
an interface yet to be decided (possibly using an anonymous SSH login which
allows a user to add a file if the signature is valid and by a user who
is in the accepted list).

To open the door, the user inserts his smartcard and signs a challenge
of the form »echo -n "OpenCorn"; date +%012s« using pkcs15-crypt.
The verification controller verifies that the signature is valid and comes
from a member which is in the accepted list and whose key has not been
revoked. If that is the case, it opens the door.

The handle, public key, as well as signature of the challenge are stored
in the log. As this log may contain sensitive data, the log will be encrypted
with an OpenGPG key whose password is 3/5 secret shared between the board
members. This key is exchanged regularly and the board members are told
regularly to delete the old keys if they see no need in keeping them.
If there is a reason to open the log, 3/5 board members can work together
to decrypt it.
